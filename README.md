# AnalogLineMaster üöó‚ú®  
**Advanced Analog IR Line Following Robot using Arduino**

AnalogLineMaster is a precision line-following robot built on Arduino using **analog IR sensors**. Unlike digital line followers, this version uses analog readings to make **fine-grained decisions** for smoother, more accurate motion. The robot also includes a **dynamic calibration feature**, ensuring consistent performance across various surfaces.

## üì¶ Features

- ‚úÖ Analog IR sensor readings for fine-tuned detection  
- ‚úÖ Dynamic threshold calibration at startup  
- ‚úÖ Modular motor control functions  
- ‚úÖ Enhanced PWM frequency for better motor control  
- ‚úÖ Debug output over Serial Monitor

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Startup Calibration**
   - Robot asks the user to place sensors on **white** surface and then on **black** line.
   - Calculates threshold value between black and white for each sensor.

2. **Main Loop Behavior**
   - Reads analog values from left and right IR sensors.
   - Compares them against calibrated thresholds.
   - Determines movement:
     - Both sensors on white ‚Üí Move Forward
     - One sensor on black ‚Üí Turn in opposite direction
     - Both sensors on black ‚Üí Stop

3. **Motor Control**
   - Speed and direction are controlled using `analogWrite()` and `digitalWrite()` via H-bridge motor driver.
   - PWM frequency on D5 and D6 is increased (~7.8 kHz) to improve low-speed responsiveness.

## üß™ How to Use

1. **Upload the code to your Arduino.**
2. **Open the Serial Monitor** at 9600 baud.
3. **Follow calibration instructions:**
   - Place robot over white surface ‚Üí wait for prompt.
   - Place robot over black line ‚Üí wait for prompt.
4. **Watch it go!**
